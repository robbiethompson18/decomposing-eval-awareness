# EvalAwareBench Data Card

## Dataset Summary
EvalAwareBench is a factor-controlled benchmark for studying evaluation awareness in large 
language models. It consists of 100 paired safety-capability tasks where each of eight 
psychology-grounded trigger factors can be independently toggled, enabling controlled study 
of which environmental cues drive evaluation awareness and whether models behave consistently 
under recognition.

## Provenance
Tasks are adapted from HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) using an LLM-assisted construction 
pipeline. Safety and capability counterparts share identical entity slots and task structure, 
with factor variations adapted to each valence. Full construction details are provided in 
the accompanying paper.

Every task directory is named after the HarmBench BehaviorID it was adapted from (all 100 
match). The original behavior text for those 100 items is vendored in `harmbench_subset.csv` 
(filtered from HarmBench's `harmbench_behaviors_text_all.csv` at commit `c0423b9`, MIT 
license) and used by the `harmbench_verbatim` anchor config — see `harmbench.py`. For the 38 
"contextual" behaviors, the baseline task's realistic entities are HarmBench's own 
ContextString entities.

## Intended Use
This dataset is intended for research on evaluation awareness in language models, including:
- Measuring model sensitivity to individual evaluative cue factors
- Studying how evaluative cues combine to raise recognition
- Assessing whether models maintain behavioral consistency under evaluation awareness

## Out-of-Scope Use
This dataset is not intended for use as training data for language models or any other 
machine learning systems. Using this dataset for model training may undermine the validity 
of future evaluation awareness research by contaminating the benchmark.

## Dataset Structure
- 100 task pairs (safety and capability counterparts)
- 8 independently toggleable trigger factors per task
- 256 factor configurations per task × 2 valences = 51.2k unique configurations
- Tasks span 10 categories: Creative Writing, Email & Messaging, Software & Code, 
  Wiki & Encyclopedia, Social Media & Forums, Song Lyrics & Composition, 
  Interpersonal Advice, Procedural Instructions, Professional Documents, 
  Consumer & Automotive

## Known Limitations
- Tasks are adapted from HarmBench and may reflect the content distribution of that benchmark
- Factor variations are theory-driven and may not exhaustively cover all evaluative cues
- The benchmark is designed for research on evaluation awareness and may also serve as 
  a safety evaluation tool
